# DevLingo 
DevLingo is a basic programming language that we created for the SER502 final project. This repository provides the source code, scripts, and tools needed to create and operate the DevLingo programming language on the Mac operating system.
# Development Environment
To build and run DevLingo, you will need following tools and systems-
- Mac

# Installation Instructions
The jar file needed to run the DevLingo can be build from the source code in the IntelliJ. But we already have the jar for you in the data directory.
